   - Password: `lecturer123`
   - Email: `john.smith@university.edu`
   - First Name: `John`
   - Last Name: `Smith`
   - Phone: `+1234567890` (optional)
   
   **Professional Information:**
   - Employee ID: `EMP001`
   - Department: `Computer Science`
   - Qualification: `PhD`
   - Specialization: `Database Systems, Machine Learning`

   **Test Course 1:**
   - Course Code: `CS301`
   - Course Name: `Advanced Database Systems`
   - Credits: `3`
   - **Assign Lecturer**: Select `John Smith - Computer Science` from dropdown
   - Description: `Advanced concepts in database design, optimization, and security including SQL injection prevention`
   - Enrollment Key: Leave empty (auto-generated) or enter `CS301_2024`

4. Click **"Create Course"**
5. Verify the course appears with:
   - ✅ Course code and name
   - ✅ Lecturer badge with name and department
   - ✅ Department information
   - ✅ Enrollment key (green badge)
   - ✅ Enrolled students count

### Step 4: Test Multiple Course Scenarios

**Test Course 2 - Different Department:**
- Course Code: `MATH201`
- Course Name: `Linear Algebra`
- Credits: `4`
- Assign Lecturer: Select a Mathematics department lecturer
- Description: `Fundamental concepts in linear algebra`

**Test Course 3 - No Lecturer Assignment:**
- Course Code: `PHYS101`
- Course Name: `Introduction to Physics`
- Credits: `3`
- Assign Lecturer: Leave as "Select a lecturer (optional)"
- Description: `Basic physics concepts`

### Step 5: Verify Course Display Features

Check that created courses show:
1. **Lecturer Information:**
   - 👨‍🏫 Lecturer name in blue badge
   - Department name below lecturer
   - OR ⚠️ "No Instructor Assigned" for courses without lecturers

2. **Course Details:**
   - Course code and name
   - Credit hours
   - Description
   - Enrollment count (👥 0 enrolled initially)

3. **Actions:**
   - 🔑 Copy enrollment key (green badge)
   - Delete course button

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### Lecturer Dropdown
- [ ] Dropdown populates with all registered lecturers
- [ ] Shows format: "First Last - Department"
- [ ] Updates course instructor field when selected
- [ ] Shows "No lecturers available" message if no lecturers exist

### Course Creation
- [ ] Form validation works (required fields)
- [ ] Auto-generates enrollment key if left empty
- [ ] Successfully creates course with lecturer assignment
- [ ] Displays success message
- [ ] Refreshes course list automatically
- [ ] Clears form after successful creation

### Course Display
- [ ] Shows lecturer information with proper badges
- [ ] Department information appears correctly
- [ ] Visual indicators work (emojis, colors)
- [ ] Copy enrollment key functionality works
- [ ] Course search/filter works

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Lecturer dropdown empty**: Create lecturers first
2. **401 errors**: Ensure you're logged in as admin
3. **Course not appearing**: Check for error messages, refresh page
4. **Lecturer not assigned**: Verify lecturer was selected in dropdown

### Debug Tools:
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
